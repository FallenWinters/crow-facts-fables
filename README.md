# crow-facts-fables
1. This project is called crow facts and fables, it is a website where there would theoretically be informations on crows and possibly other corvids.
2. I made this project because I've been very intringued in corvids recently (mainly crows) and wanted to make something in relation to my interest. Although there is not much information within the project, I did have a lot of fun looking up information on crows even if I didn't add it to the project.
3. I made this project using HTML & CSS as they are languages that I am familiar with.
4. The part that I struggled with the most was linking pages to each other, I haven't done direct coding on vscode before so I wasn't aware of the period(s) that were needed, but it was definetly fun to learn how it all works.
